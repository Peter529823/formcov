# formcov

The formCov function constructs a covariance matrix from a given vector of standard deviations (sigma) and a vector of pairwise correlation coefficients (rho). The function first checks that the number of elements in rho matches the number required for a full correlation matrix of size N × N (i.e., N*(N−1)/2 unique pairwise correlations). It then fills a correlation matrix Rho by placing the values from rho into the appropriate off-diagonal entries of the upper triangle and mirrors them to the lower triangle to maintain symmetry. The diagonal is set to ones, as each variable is perfectly correlated with itself. Finally, the covariance matrix is computed by scaling this correlation matrix using the outer product of the standard deviation vector, resulting in Cov = diag(sigma) * Rho * diag(sigma). This function is essential in statistics and finance, where modeling the joint behavior of multiple variables often requires translating volatilities and correlations into a covariance structure.
